This is to support a user who requests to update their form name. This is only possible for forms published in test.

1. Identify the form and which environment it has been deployed to: test or live. If it's live, push back as we're unable to change the name.
2. Look for the pods running the service with the following command:
`kubectl get pods -n formbuilder-services-live-dev`

3. Unpublish the form from the admin dashboard using the 'Unpublish' button.
4. Using the command from step 2, check the pods that correspond to the service are no longer running.
5. Using the admin dashboard, update the form metadata to change the `service_name` value to the desired value.
6. Check the name has changed by inspecting the Metadata API Service table. This can be done by logging onto a Metadata API pod:
    1. Start a rails console:
    `bundle exec rails c`
    2. Find the ‘service_id’ for the service modified:
    `Service.find(‘service_id’)`
    3. Check the value associated with the `name` key. This should now be the updated form name.
7. Let the form owner know that the name has changed and they have to re-publish the form, which will generate a new url.
