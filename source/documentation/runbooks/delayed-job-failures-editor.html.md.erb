It happens the job could not be processed because the corresponding PublishService id wasn't found.

1. First identify the environment, as rule of thumb what is in the alert channel is live environment while alerts in the loaw severity channel affect test environment.

2. Then connect to each editor worker pods and identify if it is the defected pod by checking if there are any delayed job:

    `Delayed::Job.count`

3. Identify the issue by checking the error:

    `Delayed:Job.last.last_error`

    If it complains with error such as

    `Couldn't find PublishService with 'id'= xxx`

4. Then look into the PublishService DB with

    `PublishService.all`

5. and check there are no id xxx

    `PublishService.find(id=xxx)`

6. We can then delete the delayed job

    `Delayed::Job.delete(id=xxx)`
