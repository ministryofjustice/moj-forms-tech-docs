## Adding a Team Member to be an Admin

Add the team members digital email address to the correct list in the [config](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor/blob/main/config/initializers/moj_forms_team.rb), raise a PR etc.

 - MOJ_FORMS_DEVS - members of the tech team.
 - MOJ_FORMS_ADMIN - members of the wider team who need admin access
 - MOJ_FORMS_TEAM - members of the whole team who do **not** need Admin access

## Transferring ownership of a form

1. Go to the environment where the form lives - the URL should indicate whether it’s in the live or test environment
2. Admin > Services - search bar doesn’t work but list is in alphabetical order
3. Select form > form details
4. Search Metadata - we’re changing the created by value
5. Search for “created_by” value which uses user ID
6. Open another tab to find the user ID
7. If the user has a @digital.justice and @justice account, check which account to use
8. Copy and check last few digits for reference
9. Admin > Services > Metadata > Select edit button
10. Replace the ‘created_by’ user id with the one that you have just copied and hit save
11. Notification in #form-builder-alert slack channel
12. Add details via comment for slack so the team knows it was a planned change

> Tip: might be helpful to copy full metadata into a googledoc temporarily so you can revert back to original meta data if needed.

## Unpublishing a form

1. Check where the uptime check exists, Admin > Uptime Checks if it’s Form Builder form it’s likely to not be in the Admin dashboard and may be managed by Cloud Platform.
 * If it’s an older form a dev will need to be involved to create a pull request to Cloud Platform to remove the check.
 * If it’s visible in the Publish services then select the delete button
2. Add a comment in the #form-builder-alerts channel to the Pingdom alert so the wider team are aware of the changes you’re making.
3. Admin > Services > Select Form in alphabetical order
4. Select Unpublish button for both live and test environments if applicable
5. Copy Service ID - top right-hand corner
6. Admin > Publish Services search with Service ID to check status of form has changed to unpublished
7. Update #form-builder-alerts channel for notification and add comment on the changes made

## Renaming a form
This is quite involved and a Tech task - raise a support request ticket on the backlog.
