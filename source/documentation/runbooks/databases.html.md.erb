We need to update the database versions or instance type, follow cloud platforms guiance.

[Cloud Platform Documentation](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#databases) which includes accessing and updating.

For the User Datastore and Submitter, the data held is only useful while being used.
The User Datastore stores the end user data while completing the form and the submitter until the data has been submitted.
Therefore,  we can add a new database and then point traffic to it. Keeping the old databases in case the need to rollback for a couple of days.

> The save and return feature will change the use of the User Datastore.

### Database List

| Name | Namespace | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| Editor | formbuilder-saas-[live/test] | MOJ Forms, holds all the data for a form (service) |
| Metadata API | Formbuilder-saas[live/test] | MOJ Forms, holds all the metadata for a form (service). Every save in the editor saves a new copy. |
| User Datastore | formbuilder-platform-[env] | Platform, used by the deployed forms to store data during the user journey. |
| Submitter | formbuilder-platform-[env] | Platform, holds the data for process the submission. |
| Publisher | formbuilder-publisher-[live/test] | Legacy, hold the publishing data for legacy forms |

[env] is a combination of [test/live] and [dev/production] - see [Platform Hosting](../services/hosting.html#let-39-s-get-complicated) for more information.
