##Â Removed Ophaned Deployed Form

SOmetime when making a change to a form, it isn't unpublihsed first. And could leave the pods running in the namespace.

These step tidies up the form.

1. Find form

    `kubectl -n formbuilder-services-<env><env> get all`

    Displays all the data on the namespace, use `grep` to filter the list.

2. delete Pods

    `kubectl -n formbuilder-services-<env>-<env> delete pod <pod-name>`

3. delete Deployment

    `kubectl -n formbuilder-services-<env>-<env> delete deployment <service>`

4. delete service

    `kubectl -n formbuilder-services-<env>-<env> delete service <service>`

5. delete autoscalling

    `kubectl -n formbuilder-services-<env>-<env> delete hpa <service>`

6. delete ingress

    `kubectl -n formbuilder-services-<env>-<env> delete ingress <service>`
