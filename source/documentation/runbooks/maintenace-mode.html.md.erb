## Context
There are times when we need to take a for or all the forms offline. This is mainly during platform changes which causes downtime.

## MOJ Forms
### Steps
#### Single Form
1. Log into MOJ Forms
2. Admin
3. Services - and find the service - inline edit
4. Update text and swap radio to Enabled
5. Save

To revert back out of maintenace mode, click the radio back to Disabled and click save.

#### All forms in an Environment
1. See [fb-maintenance-page](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-maintenance-page) - this will put all forms both legacy and moj forms into maintaince mode.

## Legacy Formbuilder
### Steps
#### Single Form
1. Log into Formbulder Publisher
2. Find the form
3. Configuration tab and Live
4. Add
    Name: `MAINTENANCE_MODE` and Value: `true`
5. Deployments tab
6. Copy the Last Commit string
7. Publish
8. Add "Commit SHA, branch or tag (optional)" add the copied SHA.
9. Publish

Repeat for each form thats needs maintence or see [fb-maintenance-page](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-maintenance-page) to put all forms in maintenance.

To take out of maintence mode, remove the config pair and republish (remember to use the sha as above 6 - 8).
