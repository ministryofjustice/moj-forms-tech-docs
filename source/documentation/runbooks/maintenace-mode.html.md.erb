## Context
There are times when we need to take a for or all the forms offline. This is mainly during platform changes which causes downtime.

## MOJ Forms
### Steps
#### Single Form
1. Log into MOJ Forms
2. Admin
3. Services - and find the service - inline edit
4. Update text and swap radio to Enabled
5. Save

To revert back out of maintenance mode, click the radio back to Disabled and click save.

#### All forms in an Environment
1. See [fb-maintenance-page](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-maintenance-page) - this will put all forms into maintenance mode.
