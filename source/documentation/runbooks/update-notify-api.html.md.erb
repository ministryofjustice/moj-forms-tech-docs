Purpose: This runbook describes the steps to update the GOV.Notify API key used in the Editor. 

### Steps 1. GOV.UK Notify
- Create a [Notify Account](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in) if you do not have one
- [Request to join](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/your-services) the MOJ Forms service
- Create new API key
- Save in the MOJ Form team's 1Password (for safe keeping)


### Step 2.  Update the Editor
 - Access the [editor-deploy](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor-deploy) internal repository 
 - The secrets are encrypted using git-crypt, so ensure you have access and have unlocked the repository
 - Update the API key in the relevant configuration file (either test or prod).
 - The key needs to be encoded with base64 before being added to the file, you can do this with the following command:

```echo -n "your-api-key" | base64 -b 0```

 - Commit, lock and push
 - Run the Editor pipeline to pick up the new api key
