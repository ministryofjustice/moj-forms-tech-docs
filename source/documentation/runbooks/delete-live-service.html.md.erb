The MOJ Forms development team have access to an Admin dashboard. This is found in the header of the Live Editor.

### Remove Pindgdom Alerts

All live forms have a Pingdom check, this is a health check to ensure the form is up and running. We need to remove this alert before unpublishing the form.

We can remove alerts by going into the 'Uptime Checks' section of the Admin dashboard. Delete the check associated with the form you want to remove.
The form should no longer be under the 'With Checks' list.

### Unpublish Form

Some forms may have been added to Pingom manually, check there is no alert in the [Cloud Platform Environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments) repo.

Once the alert has been removed, you can remove the form through the Admin dashboard:

- Find the service under the 'Services'
- Click 'Unpublish Live'
- If required, click 'Unpublish Test'

The service should now be removed.

Note: We do not not need to remove the service metadata from the database as we require this for audit purposes.
