Form Builder is hosted on the Ministry of Justice Cloud Platform. To be able to use it, you need to [connect to the cluster](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html#how-to-use-kubectl-to-connect-to-the-cluster).

If you have any questions about the Cloud Platform, contact the Cloud Platform team on the `#ask-cloud-platform` Slack channel.

## Environments
Environments are split into slightly unusual groupings.  It’s unfortunately complicated.

| Environment Type       | Potential Value    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Platform Environment   | `test` or `live`       |
| Deployment Environment | `dev` or `production` |
