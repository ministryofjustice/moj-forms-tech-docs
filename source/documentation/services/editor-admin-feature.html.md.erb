## Editor Admin Feature

The Editor Admin Feature is available only to developers in the MoJ Forms team. The feature was added to assist developers with supporting the MOJ Forms service.

Once logged into MoJ Forms, the Admin feature is accessed via the 'Admin' button located at the top of the page.

The feature is available in three environments:
- Local
- Test
- Live

### Duplicating a service
Although duplicatng a service is possible in all three environments, it is recommended we duplicate services in local and test environments only.

In the local environment, there is a 'Duplicate' button available in the 'Services' tab, which creates a copy of the service and appends the service name with '-COPY'.

In the test environment, the 'Duplicate' button is not an option and as such duplicating a service in this environment has a few more steps. It requires a copy and paste of the desired service metadata and the creation of a new form where the desired metadata will be pasted into.

Steps to duplicate a form in the Test environment:
- Create a new form
- In the Admin feature, click on the 'Services' tab in the sidebar
- Click into your newly created service and take a copy of the `service_id` and your user id, which is the value of `created_by`
- Click into the service you wish to duplicate
- Copy the metadata of the form you wish to duplicate. This can be done by clicking the 'Edit' button.
- Go back to your new form and paste the metadata in via the 'Edit' button
- Replace the `service_id` and `created_by` values with the values in step 3
- Ensure the `service_name` is unique
- Click 'Save'. A green banner should appear with a success message

Things to note:
- You can log onto the Editor via a @digital.justice or @justice account as a result an individual may have two user ids in the system
- An individual's user id will be different in all 3 environments
