# Frontend Documentation

The main bulk of customised Frontend code has been focussed on the [fb-editor](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor) project. Supporting views for the [fb-runner](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-runner) are primarily based on standard GDS templates with minimal, if any, tweaks to support [fb-editor](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor) requirements.

<br>
## File structure

The file frontend file structure follows the standard organisation for other Rails based (Webpack setup) files structures. There are too many files to list them all here, but the following outline and example files should give an idea of how things are laid out, and where to start looking.

```
app/

  assets/
    images/
    stylesheets/

  javascript/
    channels/
    images/
    packs/
      application.js
      govuk.js

    src/
      index.js
      component_dialog.js
      controller_default.js
      ...

    styles/
      application.scss
      _index.scss
      _component_dialog.scss
      ...

  views/
    layouts/
      application.html.erb
      ...

    partials/
      _header.html.erb
      ...

    services/
      index.html.erb

    ...

test/

  setup.js
  component_dialog_test.js
  ...

```


<br>
## HTML

All templates follow the Rails standard approach of being stored within this `app/views/` folder.

* Templates (.html.erb)


<br>
## CSS

Stylesheets can be found starting from `app/javascript/styles` folder. There is a linked in package for Gov.UK CSS but that is not covered within this documentation.

<small>For more information on Gov.UK CSS see the [Gov.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) documentation.</small>

* Files (.scss)


<br>
## JavaScript

JavaScript files can be found in the `app/javascript/src` folder.
