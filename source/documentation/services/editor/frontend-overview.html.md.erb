The main bulk of customised Frontend code has been focussed on the [fb-editor](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor) project. Supporting views for the [fb-runner](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-runner) are primarily based on standard GDS templates with minimal, if any, tweaks to support [fb-editor](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-editor) requirements.

## File structure

The file frontend file structure follows the standard organisation for other Rails based (Webpack setup) files structures. There are too many files to list them all here, but the following outline and example files should give an idea of how things are laid out, and where to start looking.

```
app/

  assets/
    images/
    stylesheets/

  javascript/
    channels/
    images/
    packs/
      application.js
      govuk.js

    src/
      index.js
      component_dialog.js
      controller_default.js
      ...

    styles/
      application.scss
      _index.scss
      _component_dialog.scss
      ...
