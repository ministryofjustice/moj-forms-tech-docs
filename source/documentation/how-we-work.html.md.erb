### Team
MOJ Forms is a multi disciplinary team.

The Tech Team is made from the technical roles within the wider team comprising of Developers and a Technical Architect.

Main form of communication is the private Slack channels `#moj-forms-tech` and `#form-builder-keyboard-samurais`.

The [MOJ Forms Team Intro](https://trello.com/b/u3QoR1jg/moj-forms-team-intro-board) Trello Board [Internal Link] has full information on how the work is organised and how the team works.

In summary:

- 2 week sprints
- Managed using Trello

### Onboarding
You'll need to be a part of the MOJ Github Organisation and added to the form builder team.

### Adding a Ticket
If you need to add a ticket, from an issue or if it is a good idea you've had,
add it to the correct Trello board, bring it up in the Tech Team meeting or in Slack.

### Changing Code
Please read these [technical guidelines](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/guides/using-git.html#using-git)
for how we prefer to work on code.

**In short:**

- Use a branch, no matter how small don't update the main branch
- Name the branch which describes what you are doing
- Commit regularly
- Squish commits down to atomic pieces of related work
- Push regularly
- Make sure it is non-breaking - use local acceptance tests and manual testing
- Developers are responsible for getting their work from local machine all the way through to production

### Commit  Messages / Pull Requests
We follow the [GDS Git Style Guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md).

**MOJ Forms specific guidance:**

- The commit message will describe the change you have made if you can include:
    - the context (what and why), a link to the ticket (if is long lived)
    - how the code works now and any differences you've made
    - add screenshots if it helps explain
- Make the PR small, split large ones out so they can be reviewed easier
- List the main commits in the PR
- Empty PRs messages get automatically closed by Dependabot

### Review / Merging
- When raising a PR assign reviewers from the Tech Team
- Once approved you must merge
- Be pro-active about reviewing and approving PRs
- If a team member has asked in slack for a review, once done add an emoji saying you have reviewed/approved. This is to save another team member duplicating the effort

> Before commenting on a pull request, ensure you know how the person would prefer to get feedback. This might involve asking them first. Feedback options include face-to-face, pairing, via email/Slack, or commenting on a pull request
