### Team
MOJ Forms is a multi disciplinary team.

The Tech Team is made from the technical roles within the wider team comprising of Developers and a Technical Architect.

Main form of communication is the private Slack channels `#moj-forms-tech` and `#form-builder-keyboard-samurais`.

The [MOJ Forms Team Intro](https://trello.com/b/u3QoR1jg/moj-forms-team-intro-board) Trello Board [Internal Link] has full information on how the work is organised and how the team works.

In summary:

- 2 week sprints
- Managed using Trello

### Onboarding
You'll need to be a part of the MOJ Github Organisation and added to the form builder team.

### Adding a Ticket
If you need to add a ticket, from an issue or if it is a good idea you've had,
add it to the correct Trello board, bring it up in the Tech Team meeting or in Slack.

### Changing Code
Please read these [technical guidelines](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/documentation/guides/using-git.html#using-git)
for how we prefer to work on code.

**In short:**

- Use a branch, no matter how small don't update the main branch
- Name the branch which describes what you are doing
- Commit regularly
- Squish commits down to atomic pieces of related work
- Push regularly
- Make sure it is non-breaking - use local acceptance tests and manual testing
- Developers are responsible for getting their work from local machine all the way through to production

### Commit  Messages / Pull Requests
We follow the [GDS Git Style Guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md).

**MOJ Forms specific guidance:**

- The commit message will describe the change you have made if you can include:
    - the context (what and why), a link to the ticket (if is long lived)
    - how the code works now and any differences you've made
    - add screenshots if it helps explain
- Make the PR small, split large ones out so they can be reviewed easier
- List the main commits in the PR
- Empty PRs messages get automatically closed by Dependabot

### Review / Merging
- When raising a PR assign reviewers from the Tech Team
- Once approved you must merge
- Be pro-active about reviewing and approving PRs
- If a team member has asked in slack for a review, once done add an emoji saying you have reviewed/approved. This is to save another team member duplicating the effort

> Before commenting on a pull request, ensure you know how the person would prefer to get feedback. This might involve asking them first. Feedback options include face-to-face, pairing, via email/Slack, or commenting on a pull request

### Support
Developers are on support during working hours and rotated on a weekly basis, the rota is found in the Team Google Drive.
If you are unable to be on support (ie: due to leave etc), let the team know on the [#form-builder-keyboard-samurais](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/G015FTRF1JB) channel and see if you can swap your week or days with another developer.

The purpose of the support rota is to have one point of contact to handle support issues and questions accordingly. This will hopefully ensure other team members are not distracted by support tasks and alerts.

The individual on support is not expected to solve support issues on their own - they should reach out to the appropriate team member as required.

The [MOJ Forms Tech Docs](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/moj-forms-tech-docs/) should assist in resolving common issues that arise. Common alerts are outlined in the [Alerts Quick Guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/moj-forms-tech-docs/documentation/runbooks/alerts-quick-guide.html#alerts-quick-guide). The [Delayed Job Failures](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/moj-forms-tech-docs/documentation/runbooks/delayed-job-failures.html#delayed-job-failures) might also be useful to refer to when on support.

### Slack Channel
The first port of call for users of Formbuilder is the [#ask-formbuilder](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CE26QEL1Z) Slack channel. This channel will be monitored by the Product Managers who will contact the support dev as required.

### Alerts
We have two alerts channels, [#form-builder-alerts](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CH4FJB8E4) and [#form-builder-alerts-low-severity](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C013L7PA4N4).

Generally, we do not need to action the alerts in the #form-builder-alerts-low-severity channel as these alerts are concerned about the test environment. However, if there are any Sentry alerts that have been triggered and dealt with, please remember to resolve these in [Sentry](https://sentry.io/organizations/ministryofjustice/issues/).

### Incidents
We have an incidents channel, [#form-builder-incidents](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/GPW15H23V)
When an incident occurs, the steps to take are provided in the [MOJ Forms Tech Docs](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/moj-forms-tech-docs/documentation/so-you-are-having-an-incident.html#so-you-re-having-an-incident).

### Security Updates
We receive automated alerts on our Github repositories, the person on support is responsible for checking if any of these alerts are security issues that can be rectified. If a security issue is not easily resolved, raise a card in Trello and notify the rest of the team.
